      <h2>When we first met (February 5, 2024)</h2>
      <p>We met on OmeTV but its a shame wala man lang akong screenshot or any documentation of how we met.
        <br>
        <br>
        Just know that I feel very lucky to have met you and love you.</p>

      <h2>How it all started</h2>
      <img src="./images/conversation.png" alt="how its tarted">
      <p>Went to Sydney para mag renew ng passport at makita si Hozier. I didn't have any friends who knows him, so I remembered you and asked if you were still going to pursue Australia. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Found out you were my carbon copy and it was really unexpected but a pleasant surprise.</p>

      <p>We were on a call watching this and it was very awkward, but I vividly remember how you laugh and it's the best.</p>

      <h2>When we both knew we liked each other</h2>
      <img src="./images/catchingfeelings.png" alt="">
      <p>This wasn't the most pleasant way to find out we liked each other but knowing that you were catching feelings for me was enough for me to hold on really tightly despite your attempts to push me back. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Looking back on this, made me realize how far we've come to this day.</p>

      <h2>Your birthday</h2>

      <p>We got separated together for your personal reason, and I promised you that I will greet you a happy birthday the moment the clock hits 12:00 AM. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This is also when I was sure that you liked me from your responses, and there wasn't any day that I did not think about you either. Like I said, those 3 days felt like the longest days I have ever had.</p>

      <p>I thought we were over the moment you said you couldn't see your future with me but I still persisted after finding out you were an Avoidant from my therapist so I reached out to you and we're back once again. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You were in "Bicol" for a week and I took the time to learn the guitar for you and to show you that I am doing well handling myself so you do not worry like the worrywart you are.

      <p>I managed to cluster up the courage to send you a letter about how I want you to be mine and that's when you finally told me about your insecurities. Really proud of u!
        <br>
        <br>
        I reassured and called you, and I was just so happy to finally talk to you and see your pretty face.</p>

      <p>I wanted to see you for so long and I also wanted to make sure that you get the reassurance that you need. We were together for two weeks but it went by so fast.
         <br>
        <br>
        I saw my future with you way back but being with you and sharing the same roof for almost 2 weeks, I knew I wanted my future to be with you.

      <img src="./images/sleeptogether.jpg" alt="sleeping">
      <p>We have been through a lot together despite knowing each other for a short period of time. They may not all be pleasant but they surely make an impact for us to grow for the better. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I wish for us to last for eternity. I will always love you and I miss you every single breath I take that you are not with me.

        Love, Sean!
